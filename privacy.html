                    <p class="title-h3 mb-30 mt-30" data-dsn-ajax="title"  style="font-family:Libre Baskerville">California Privacy Rights & Notices</p>
                    <p>If the processing of your personal information is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), you have certain rights with respect to that information:</p>
                    <ul style="padding-left:50px">
                    <li class="mb-10 mt-10"> -Right to Know. You can request access to the personal information we collected about you in the last 12 months. You can also request information about the categories of personal information we collected, the sources of collection, the purposes for collection and sharing of this information, the categories of information we shared, and the categories of third parties with whom we shared this information. Note that we have provided much of this information above in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                    <li class="mb-10 mt-10"> -Right to Request Deletion. You can request that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions.</li>
                    <li class="mb-10 mt-10"> -Right to Opt-Out. You can opt-out from any sharing of your personal information with third parties to the extent that such sharing constitutes a “sale” of that data under the CCPA. You can find more information on these practices, including how to exercise your opt-out right, in our Cookie Policy.</li>
                    <li class="mb-10 mt-10"> -Right to Non-Discrimination. You will not be discriminated against by BENJI for exercising rights set out in the CCPA.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>In the past 12 months, we have disclosed, for a business purpose, data from each of the categories of personal information we maintain to our business partners, as described above.</p>
                    <p>The CCPA defines the “sale” of personal information very broadly, and some of our use of third-party cookies and tracking technologies as described in this Privacy Policy may be considered a “sale” under that definition. Specifically, in the past 12 months, we have allowed our advertising and analytics providers to collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs through our sites and apps when you use our online services. We do not otherwise “sell” personal information.</p>
                    <p class="title-h3 mb-30 mt-30" data-dsn-ajax="title"  style="font-family:Libre Baskerville">Other sites and services</p>
                    <p>The Service may contain links to websites, mobile applications, and other online services operated by third parties.  These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party.  In addition, our content may be included on web pages or in mobile applications or other online services that are not associated with us. We do not control websites, mobile applications or online services operated by third parties, and we are not responsible for their actions.</p>
                    <p class="title-h3 mb-30 mt-30" data-dsn-ajax="title"  style="font-family:Libre Baskerville">Children</p>
                    <p>The Service is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian as required by law, we will delete it.</p>
                    <p class="title-h3 mb-30 mt-30" data-dsn-ajax="title"  style="font-family:Libre Baskerville">Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>
                    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the Service. If required by law we will also provide notification of changes in another way that we believe is reasonably likely to reach you, such as via email or another manner through the Service.  Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the modified version (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of the Service after the effective date of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
