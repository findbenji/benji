                      <p>This Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) describes your rights and responsibilities related to your use of REAMAR’s website, mobile application(s), and services as a registered REAMAR user, and what you can expect from us.</p>
              
                      <p>By creating your REAMAR account during the account sign-up process, or by otherwise indicating that you agree, you are agreeing to these terms, so please take a moment to read this legally binding Agreement, along with the 'Privacy Policy'</p>
              
                      <p>If you use any REAMAR website or mobile app but are not a registered user, by using the website or mobile app, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and acknowledge that you have read the 'Privacy Policy'.</p>
              
              
                      <p class="title-h3 mb-30 mt-30" data-dsn-ajax="title"  style="font-family:Libre Baskerville">REAMAR Service</p>
              
                      <p>REAMAR is a social network for trusted connections and the exchange of helpful information, goods, and services. We use “REAMAR” here to refer to the REAMAR websites and our iOS and Android applications (also referred to as our “Service”). We also use “REAMAR”, “we”, “us” and “our” to refer to REAMAR LLC., a Delaware corporation, which provides our Service.</p>
              
                      <p class="title-h3 mb-30 mt-30" data-dsn-ajax="title"  style="font-family:Libre Baskerville">Nature of the REAMAR Service</p>
                      <p>The REAMAR Service consists of a web application, mobile application(s), and other related tools, support and services that REAMAR, REAMAR users (“Service Users”) and third-party suppliers and providers of pets, pet adoption, pet placement, or pet care products or services (“Pet Products and Services” and such suppliers and providers, “Providers”) can use to find, communicate with and interact with each other. For purposes of this Agreement, Providers are also Service Users.</p>
              
                      <p class="title-h3 mb-30 mt-30" data-dsn-ajax="title"  style="font-family:Libre Baskerville">Service Users are Solely Responsible for Evaluating Providers</p>
                      <p>We make no representations or warranties about the quality of products or services provided by Providers, or about your interactions and dealings with other Service Users. Providers listed on REAMAR are not under the direction or control of REAMAR, and Providers determine in their own discretion how to provide Pet Products and Services.</p>
              
                      <p>REAMAR does not employ, recommend, or endorse Providers or Service Users, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be responsible or liable for the performance or conduct of Service Users, whether online or offline.</p>
              
                      <p>We may conduct an initial review of Provider profiles but do not otherwise screen Service Users, including Providers. You should exercise caution and use your independent judgment before engaging a Provider, providing Pet Products and Services, or otherwise interacting with Service Users, via the REAMAR Service or otherwise. Service Users and Providers are solely responsible for making decisions that are in the best interests of themselves and their pets.</p>
              
                      <p>Service Users are solely responsible for evaluating the suitability of Providers for the services they offer to provide. REAMAR does not endorse reviews of Providers by other Service Users that may be available via the REAMAR Service, and REAMAR makes no commitments that such reviews are accurate or legitimate.</p>

                      <p>Each individual is limited to one account, and you may not share your account password with anyone else (even a family user sharing your home) or allow someone else to use your personal account.

                      <p>Payment processing services for REAMAR are currently provided by Stripe (“Stripe” or the “Processor”) and are subject to the Stripe Terms of Service and Stripe Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Processor Terms”).

                      <p>For any goods purchased by you on the REAMAR Service, title and risk of loss pass to you upon our transfer of the products to the delivery carrier. We are not liable for any delays in shipments, nor are we required to refund orders lost in the mail. However, if an item is not delivered by the carrier, you must notify us within 14 days of the originally scheduled delivery date. Any decision regarding whether or not to replace a lost item is within our sole discretion, upon timely notice. All sales of products are final.

                      <p class="title-h3 mb-30 mt-30" data-dsn-ajax="title"  style="font-family:Libre Baskerville">Applicability</p>
                      <p>You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the REAMAR Service, mobile apps, and service, or to any aspect of your relationship with REAMAR, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.</p>
                      <p class="title-h3 mb-30 mt-30" data-dsn-ajax="title"  style="font-family:Libre Baskerville">Arbitration rules and forum</p>
                      <p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to REAMAR LLC.,2633 Lincoln Blvd #134, Santa Monica, CA 90405.The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.  JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                      <p class="title-h3 mb-30 mt-30" data-dsn-ajax="title"  style="font-family:Libre Baskerville">Authority of arbitrator</p>
                      <p>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and REAMAR.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p>
